    <h1>Introduction:</h1>

    	<p>My name is chisom, I’m from Nigeria. I came to the U.S in 2016 and found it really boring, but that was because I had no friends. Right now I have less friends because I find it hard to communicate; mostly because I’m shy and sometimes not in the mood to talk. It’s sad.</p>
        <p>When I’m free - meaning, when I’m done studying - I watch youtube videos on <strong>Michio Kaku:</strong> my favorite Physicist.I also look at cool Minion memes.</p>
